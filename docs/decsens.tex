\begin{abstract} % 144 incl cites
The concept of temperature sensitivity is fundamental across scientific disciplines, especially in biology, where temperature determines the rate of many plant, animal and ecosystem processes. Recently, a growing body of literature has found declining temperature sensitivities with global warming \citep{fu2015,gusewell2017,piao2017,dai2019ag}. Such declines are predicted if warming causes fundamental shifts in underlying biological processes, yet to date we lack clear evidence of biological changes. Here we present a simple explanation for observed declining sensitivities: the use of linear models to estimate non-linear temperature responses. Simple corrections for the non-linearity of temperature response in simulated data, and long-term phenological data from Europe, remove the apparent decline. By accelerating biological time, climate change makes methods that may suffice in stationary systems problematic for inferring mechanism from measurements today.

\section{Main text} % 989 right now
Climate change has reshaped biological processes around the globe, with shifts in the timing of major life history events (phenology), in carbon dynamics and other ecosystem processes \citep{IPCC:2014sm}. With increasing warming,  a growing body of literature has documented changes in temperature sensitivity---the magnitude of a biological response scaled per $^{\circ}$C---including declining responses to temperature over time \citep{fu2015,gusewell2017,piao2017,dai2019ag}, more uniform sensitivities across elevation \citep{vitasse2018}, and lower sensitivities in warmer, urban areas \citep{meng2020}.\\

Researchers often suggest these changes in temperature sensitivity are driven by shifts in underlying biological processes. For example,  fundamental science suggests the dominant control of warm spring temperatures on many temperate phenological events (e.g., leafout, insect emergence) may weaken with warming as additional evironmental triggers, such as winter temperatures and photoperiod, play a larger role. Yet, providing strong evidence of this mechanistic link has proven difficult \citep[e.g.,][]{fu2015,gauzere2019}, in part because of uncertainty in how these other factors control phenological events \citep{chuine2016}, and because these factors are often correlated in nature \citep[e.g.,][]{fu2015}. \\
%  fundamental science suggests that warm spring temperatures are the main controller of many temperate phenological events (e.g., leafout, insect emergence), but winter temperatures and photoperiod can also determine the timing of events. Thus, an increased role of winter temperatures or photoperiod could explain observed declines in the temperature sensitivity of plant phenology with warming. 
% ... fundamental science predicts declines in the temperature sensitivity of temperate plant phenology, as the role of spring temperature diminishes relative to the increasing importance of winter temperatures and daylength % For example, the temperature sensitivity of spring leafout may decline if warmer winters mean plants fail to receive enough winter chilling.  


% Given the difficulty of providing strong evidence that shifting biology underlies shifting temperature sensitivities, a small but increasing number of studies have focused on potential issues---shifts in temperature variance and complexities in defining relevant temporal windows---in commonly used metrics of temperature sensitivity.
Alongside efforts to identify the biology that may underlie shifting temperature sensitivities, a small but increasing number of studies have focused on potential statistical issues in common metrics of temperature sensitivity. These studies have highlighted important complexities that can influence estimated sensitivities \citep{clark2014a,gusewell2017,keenan2019}. They have generally not, however, explained observed shifts. And all have examined sensitivities through methods based on assumptions of linearity, generally relying on some form of linear regression to compute a change in a quantity---days to leafout or carbon sequestered, for example---per $^{\circ}$C---thus ignoring that many biological responses to temperature are non-linear. \\ %  to date have shown how shifts in temperature variance and related complexities in defining relevant temporal windows

Many observed biological events are the result of continuous processes that depend on temperature, which are discretized into temporal units for measurement. Leafout, for example, is generally observable only after a certain thermal sum is reached, and plants will reach this threshold more quickly---in calendar time---when average daily temperatures are warmer. Biologically, however, the plants require the exact same temperature sum and have not shifted their sensitivity to temperature. Indeed any process observed or measured as the time until reaching a threshold is inversely proportional to the speed at which that threshold is approached. Thus, at very low temperatures plants would never leaf out and at higher temperatures they could leaf out in only a matter of days---yet sensitivities estimated from simple linear regression at higher (warmer) temperatures would appear much lower than those observed at lower temperatures (given the low variance of the response variable). Warming acts to step on the biological accelerator, and makes the use of classic calendar time precarious. \\
% calendar time is the same, but the biological time is much greater
% amount of change that can occur in a day depends on temperature

Simple simulations of biological events observed after a certain thermal sum show that sensitivities estimated from simple linear regression will always appear to decline with warming (Fig. \ref{fig:basicsimswpep}, \ref{fig:basicsims}, code link). Examining the same responses using proportional change or logged variables removes the apparent decline, and yields a constant sensitivity of -1 (the expected slope given that these sensitivities effectively include temperature as both the predictor and response variable, see `Model of leafout timing' in SI). Using alternative simulations where warming increases the required thermal sum for a biological event---a common hypothesis for declining sensitivities in spring phenological events---yields declining sensitivities that remain after adjusting response variables using proportions or logs (Fig. \ref{fig:simsshiftcues}). \\

Comparing these simulation results with long-term leafout data from Europe, we find little evidence for declining sensitivities with warming (Figs. \ref{fig:basicsimswpep}, \ref{fig:pepper10yr}, \ref{fig:pepper20yr}). An apparent decline in sensitivity for silver birch (\emph{Betula pendula}) from -4.3 days/$^{\circ}$C to -3.6 days/$^{\circ}$C from 1950-1960 compared to 2000-2010 disappears using a log-log regression (-0.17 versus -0.22). We see similar corrections using 20-year windows, and a potential increase in sensitivity for European beech (\emph{Fagus sylvatica}, see Tables \ref{tab:pep10yr}-\ref{tab:pep20yr}). Across both species, there are large declines in the variance of leafout dates---(declines of roughly 50\%, see Tables \ref{tab:pep10yr}-\ref{tab:pep20yr}), as expected if warming accelerates towards a thermal threshold that triggers leafout \citep[and in contrast to predictions from shifting biology, see][]{ford2016}. \\

Inferring biological processes from statistical artifacts is not a new problem \citep[e.g.,][]{nee2005}, but climate change provides a new challenge in discerning mechanism from measurements because it accelerates biological time over years and reshapes the spatial landscape of temperature. Before anthropogenic climate change, the use of sensitivities calculated from linear models may have been less prone to yielding notable temporal patterns. With warming declining sensitivities should be the null model for analyses using simple linear regressions, and highlights how the nonstationarity of climate change upends methods and approaches that may work in stationary systems \citep{Milly:2008yu,tempeco}.  Attempts to use sensitivities to identify shifting biological process across space has always required caution \citep[e.g.,][]{tansey2017}, but climate change adds further complexity. \\ % Phillimore2012

Research inferring biological processes from differing temperature sensitivities across space and time must look beyond shifting sensitivities with warming as strong evidence. Other fields, focused on temperature sensitivity generally use approaches that avoid the issue we have outlined here \citep[e.g.,][]{yuste2004}. Researchers have called for greater use of process-based models \citep{keenan2019}, which is also beneficial. But many fields, still lack the underlying mechanistic understanding to robustly develop and fit process-based models, with many parameters and aspects of the model specification unknown \citep{chuine2016}. Thus we expect more exploratory methods, such as regression, will continue to inform science, but findings from such methods must be interrogated---confronted with multiple diverse methods of calculating similar metrics, tested for logical outcomes, and compared against null models based on biological time. \\ % Greater use of data simulation and null models can highlight issues and bring greater focus on mechanisms. 
% Process-based models can help some, but are not an obvious solution given gaps in our understanding that make parameter estimation difficult. We say process models are good, but not the whole answer. Instead we need more people to simulate process and stats and see what the hell they're doing... try lots of methods.

\caption{\textbf{Shifts in temperature sensitivities with warming occur when using linear models for non-linear processes.} Estimated sensitivities decline with warming in simulations with no underlying change in the biological process when sensitivities were estimated with simple linear regression (estimated across 45 sites with a base temperature of $\mathcal{N}(6,4)$). This decline disappears when performing the regression on logged predictor and response variables. Such issues may underlie declining sensitivities calculated from observational data, including long-term observations of leafout across Europe (`observations,' using data for \emph{Betula pendula} from PEP725 from for the 45 sites that had complete data for 1950-1960 and 2000-2010), which show a lower sensitivity with warming when calculated on raw data, but no change in sensitivity using logged data. Symbols and lines represent means $\pm$ standard deviations of regressions across sites. } % Estimates of sensitivities from logged variables were generally much lower than -1, suggesting other factors or a better metric of temperature underlie leafout dates.

\section{Outline \& notes}

Need to work on this, notes to date on % \href{https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/decsens/wiki/Statistical-artifacts-in-sensitivities}{here}.\\

\emph{Meeting with Jonathan Auerbach \& Andrew Gelman on 18 December 2019:} 

Fundamental issue is that we have a non-linear relationship ($y=1/x$) being described by a linear function ($y=x$), where $x$ is the mean temp and 1 could be the GDD. The time until you reach a threshold is inversely proportional to the speed you go at. So, at very low temperatures plants would (theoretically) never leaf out and at 200 C days it would take one day. \\

The classic algebra example (they tell me) is how long does it take to drive 200 miles? It depends on your miles per hour. (Side note by Lizzie while typing up these notes: the speed analogy is sort of nice, climate change is stepping on the accelerator, making this algebra problem relevant.)

\begin{itemize}
\item The artifact comes from the mean getting larger while the variance goes down (I think, I may have this noted wrong, but it's about the mean relative to the variance, not just the variance or the mean). If you make the variance scale with the mean you will see the issue go away (though Andrew pointed out this should be done on the $SD$ scale, not the $var$).
\item ``The statistical artifact is that fitting a linear regression requires linearity''said  Jonathan Auerbach.
\item If this was all simple, we could fix it two ways: percent scale (decline relative to some base C temp) or log both axes. (Note from Lizzie: but we don't know when to start accumulating so not sure how this works, though Jonathan seemed to have insight into this.)
\item An example of inferring process from an artifact is regression to the mean, though Andrew pointed out regression to the mean is more complicated compared to this as regression to the mean is a statistical issue and this is just a deterministic reality. 
\item Convexity in economics has had similar problems to this. 
\end{itemize}

Sagarin 2001: False estimates of the advance of spring (leap year issues). \\

I noticed as you go back to 2014 and before in my ISI searches, you get a lot of soil respiration lit. And in that literature they use $Q_{10}$ for temperature sensitivities, ``[t]he temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is often expressed as the Q10 value; that is, the factor by which soil respiration increases by a 10°C increase in temperature (e.g., Kirschbaum, 1995; Van't Hoff, 1898),'' which would avoid a good dose of the issue we're seeing.\\  % definition from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GB005644

Shen et al. 2014 shows earlier-season vegetation more temperature-sensitive, which is the same artifact. Do we want to work this in?
