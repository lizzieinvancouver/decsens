\section{Model of leafout timing}
In our model, leafout day, $n_\beta$, is the day, $n$, that cumulative daily temperature, $S_0^n$, hits the threshold, $\beta$. For simplicity, we assume researchers 
know the day temperatures start to accumulate, $n=0$. However, our model is easily extended to the case where researchers choose a window of temperatures, for example March 1 to April 30.

\subsection{Random walk model}

We use the following notation:
\begin{align*}
n & = \text{day since temperatures start to accumulate, }  n = 0, 1, ..., N\\
X_n & = \text{observed temperature on day $n$} \\
S_0^n & = \sum_{i = 0}^{n}X_i, \text{the cumulative daily temperature from day $0$ to day $n$}\\ 
M_0^n & = \frac{S_0^n}{n}, \text{the average daily temperature from day $0$ to day $n$}\\ 
\beta & = \text{the threshold of interest, } \beta > 0, \text{ (for example, F* or required GDD)}\\
n_{\beta} &  = \underset{n}{\text{argmin}} \ S_n > \beta, \text{the first day the cumulative daily temperature passes the threshold} \\
& \ \ \ \text{(for example, day of year (doy) of budburst).}
\end{align*} 

We model $X_n$ as a Gaussian random walk, $X_n \overset{\text{i.i.d}}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(n \Delta, \sigma)$, where $\Delta > 0$ is the day-over-day increase in average temperatures and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. Note that this model differs from the typical Gaussian random walk because of the factor $n$.

\subsection{The inverse relationship between leafout time and average temperature at leafout time}

Under this model, $M_0^{n_{\beta}}$ and $n_{\beta}$ are inversely proportional. To see why, assume for the moment that the cumulative daily temperature hits the threshold exactly on leafout day. That is, $S_0^{n_\beta} = \beta$.
Then $$M_0^{n_{\beta}} = \frac{S_0^{n_{\beta}}}{{n_{\beta}}} = \frac{\beta}{{n_{\beta}}}$$ rearranging yields $${n_{\beta}} = \frac{\beta}{M_0^{n_{\beta}}}$$

Much research uses linear regression to quantify the relationship between $n_{\beta}$ and $M_0^{n_{\beta}}$. Regressing $n_{\beta}$ on $M_0^{n_{\beta}}$ finds a best fit line to the inverse curve, ${n_{\beta}} = \frac{\beta}{M_0^{n_{\beta}}}$. The relationship can be linearized with a logarithm transformation: $\log ({n_{\beta}}) = \log(\beta) - \log (M_0^{n_{\beta}})$. That is, $\log(n_{\beta})$ is linear in log-average daily temperature with slope -1 and intercept $\log(\beta)$ (e.g., in simulations in Fig. \ref{fig:basicsimswpep} is -1, and intercept is $\log(200)=5.3$).

\subsection{Declining sensitivity is explained by the declining variance of the average temperature}

Under the model, the mean and variance of $M_0^n$ is E$(M_0^n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^n i \Delta = \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \Delta $ and Var$(M_0^n) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$.\\

Consider two years, $A$ and $B$, where $A_0^n$ denotes the average temperature in year $A$ by day $n$ with increase $\Delta_A$ and $B_0^n$ the average temperature in year $B$ with increase $\Delta_B$. Suppose year $B$ is warmer than year $A$, $\Delta_A < \Delta_B$, so that $A_0^n$ typically gets to $\beta$ in $n_A$ steps and $B_0^n$ gets to $\beta$ in $n_B$ steps, $n_A  > n_B$. \\

Then Var$(A_0^{n_A}) =  \frac{\sigma^2}{n_A} < \frac{\sigma^2}{n_B}$ = Var$(B_0^{n_B})$.

\section{Results using long-term empirical data from PEP725} %http://www.pep725.eu}
To examine how estimated sensitivities shift over time, we selected sites of two common European tree species (silver birch, \emph{Betula pendula}, and European beech, \emph{Fagus sylvatica}) that have long-term observational data of leafout, through the Pan European Phenology Project \citep[PEP725,][]{Templ2018}. We used a European-wide gridded climate dataset \emph{\citep[{\normalfont E-OBS},][]{cornes2018}} to extract daily minimum and maximum temperature for the grid cells where observations of leafout for these two species were available. We used sites with leafout across our full temporal windows to avoid possible confounding effects of shifting sites over time (see Tables \ref{tab:pep10yr}-\ref{tab:pep20yr} for numbers of sites per species x window). \\

Our estimates of temperature sensitivity from a linear model using untransformed variables shows a decline in sensitivity with recent warming for \emph{Betula pendula} over 10 and 20-year windows, but no decline for \emph{Fagus sylvatica}; using logged variables estimates appeared more similar over time or sometimes suggested an increase sensitivity (see Figs. \ref{fig:pepper10yr}-\ref{fig:pepper20yr}, Tables \ref{tab:pep10yr}-\ref{tab:pep20yr}). This shift in estimated sensitivity when regressing with untransformed versus logged variables suggests these declining estimates from untransformed variables are unlikely caused by biological shifts and driven instead by using linear regression for a non-linear process. This hypothesis is supported further by large declines in variance of leafout in recent decades. \\

Shifts in variance provide another hurdle to robust estimates of temperature sensitivity. Previous work has highlighted how shifting temperature variance (over space and/or time) could lead to shifting estimates of temperature sensitivities \citep{keenan2019}, but our results stress that variance in both leafout and temperature are shifting. If both shift in step, estimates would not be impacted by changes in temperature variance, but our results suggest variance in temperature---for these data---has declined more than variance in leafout, though both have declined substantially in recent decades (Tables \ref{tab:pep10yr}-\ref{tab:pep20yr}). \\

While within any small temperature range the relationship may appear linear, is non-linear relationship becomes clear across the range shown here (left).
