Some climwin notes:

Model selects the best model based on deltAIC against the baseline model you give it. 

It tests 4 'aggregate statistics' ...

1) mean (so take the mean climate over the 'best window')
2) max (so take the max climate over the 'best window')
3) min (so take the min climate over the 'best window')
4) slope -- take the SLOPE of the climate data in the window (this is the only method I believe has ever been tested with simulated data according to their publications).

from Simmons et al. 2019, 

"The aggregate statistic used in this method is typically a sum, mean (e.g. of the daily mean, minimum, or maximum temperature), minimum (e.g. the minimum mean daily temperature reached in a focal window) or maximum (e.g. the maximum mean daily temperature reached in a focal window) envi- ronmental value, or the slope of environmental change across the window (the gradient of a linear model of daily mean temperature against date within the focal window)."

Requires a reference day:

Often selected as AFTER the latest observed event date.

All windows are reported as DAYS PRIOR to this date. 

Absolute versus relative windows:
Simmonds et al.2 019, "The temporal position is either tied to a reference calendar day (i.e. 20 May) or to the time event itself (i.e. days prior to event); these approaches are absolute sliding time window (SWA) analysis and relative sliding time window (SWR) analysis, respectively (van de Pol et al., 2016)."

What we have tried:

Baseline model of lm(1~mean(budburst date))
Linear fit
Try the 4 default 
'aggregate statistics'
Absolute window (mostly I think?)

Ran it on Betula pendula for Europe over two climate windows.
Ran it on Betula pendula for Europe over two climate windows but randomized leafout.
Used some of the simulated climate data I have created for the decsens paper
